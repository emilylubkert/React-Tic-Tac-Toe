# React Tic Tac Toe

## Description
This is a simple tic tac toe game built with React using Create React App. A message shows whose turn it is, and users can click their chosen square to mark X or O when it's their turn.

## How to Run
You can play the game at https://emilylubkert.github.io/React-Tic-Tac-Toe/ .

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
- Add dropdown menu so users can choose which player goes first (X or 0)
- Add reset button to clear squares and play again
